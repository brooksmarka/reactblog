# reactblog

### This application allows the user to easily create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

* Posts data is loaded from the api once the PostsIndex component mounts and utilizes redux-promise as middleware before the action hits the reducer to handle the asynchronous network call.



_This project was bootstrapped with the [ReduxSimpleStarter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) package._
